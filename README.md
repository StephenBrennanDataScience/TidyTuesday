# TidyTuesday

This repository contains my contributions to the [#TidyTuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday); 
a weekly social data project that focusses on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful and/or 
beautiful charts with `{ggplot2}`, `{tidyr}`, `{dplyr}` and other tools that are part of the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem.
The project was founded in 2018 by [Thomas Mock](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/) and organized by the [R4DS ("`R` for Data Science") online 
learning community](https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity). 
The intent is to provide a safe and supportive forum to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills.
